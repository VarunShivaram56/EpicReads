Epic Reads - Book Recommendation System

Overview  
Epic Reads is a fun and interactive book recommendation system that helps you find your next favorite read. The project is made up of two main parts:  
 	Machine Learning Notebook: A Jupyter Notebook where all the coding is done to figure out which books you might like.  
 	Web App: A simple and easy-to-use Streamlit app where you can pick a book and get recommendations instantly 

It uses cool techniques like collaborative filtering and cosine similarity to give you personalized book suggestions.


What is this project  
This project is all about making book recommendations easy and fun. If you're someone who loves reading but struggles to find the next book to dive into, Epic Reads is here to save the day. Just select a book you like, and itâ€™ll suggest similar ones you might enjoy.



How does it work 
The system uses a smart algorithm to analyze how books are related based on user preferences. It works in three simple steps:  
1. Processes book data to figure out how books are similar.  
2. Runs a recommendation model to find the best matches for the book you pick.  
3. Shows you the recommendations with book covers in the web app 



How can you use it 

What you need  
- Python (version 3.9 or newer)  
- Streamlit  

Steps to run the project 
1. Clone the repo/ Dowload the zip file:  
  	Choose any of the texteditor and open all the folders in the zip file in the editor
	Place the required files (`pivot.pkl`, `similarity.pkl`, and `popular.pkl`) in the project folder.
   
2. Install everything you need:  
   	The main python libraries required are
	1.Keras
	2.Pandas
	3.Streamlit
	4.numpy
	
  
3. Run the python file in the terminal:

Future Ideas  

Hereâ€™s what I plan to add in the future:  
- Login system to make the recommendations more personal.  
- Add more advanced recommendation techniques.  
- Let users upload their reading history to improve suggestions.  
- Expand the dataset to include more books and genres.
